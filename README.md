# cripsy-boilerplate

Flat Sass Boilerplate to give you a amount of Basic Settings, Components, Helpers,
Mixins and Functions. It uses also the following Libraries,

* normalize.css / (https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)[https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/]
* reflex-grid / (http://reflexgrid.com/docs/)[http://reflexgrid.com/docs/]

Many Boilerplates and also Frameworks, are trying to hard adding styles that
are most time will be overwritten to make it work for you. This causes a loss in
Performance and more Fighting with the Framework and the Documentation.

## Coding Style

The Boilerplate uses as Coding Style (http://getbem.com/)[BEM], but as a more
simpler idea of it. One of the Benefits of BEM is that you create Components and
can reuse them. But one the other hand it can be really Strange if you overthinking it.

## Not Fancy but Small

Components are created to give you a Structure and a Basic set of Styles and
not that they look fancy. The Idea is to extend each Compontent and save up
a Bunch of CSS Code, and so get more Performance and less Errors.
Of Course is really Fancy to get more Performance.

## Only Include if you need it

Components and Helpers are organizes as Mixins, that makes it a little easier to
add. Also it can be used to create multiples css files for each single site you
need on a site oder
